# Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Naive Bayes classifier is the fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.
                  
                                                     # P(h/D) = P(D/h) * p(H) / p(D)

    P(h): the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data). This is known as the prior probability of h.
    P(D): the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis). This is known as the prior probability.
    P(h|D): the probability of hypothesis h given the data D. This is known as posterior probability.
    P(D|h): the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true. This is known as posterior probability.
