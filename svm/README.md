# SVM 
* Here we are using kernel trick : The SVM algorithm is implemented in practice using a kernel. A kernel transforms an input data space into the required form. SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick. Here, the kernel takes a low-dimensional input space and transforms it into a higher dimensional space.
